<h1>About Me</h1>

  Ontario.I completed my Computer Programming course from Seneca College Of
  Applied Arts And Technology in 2022.

  Currently, I work as a crew trainer at Mc'donalds. I completed a web
  development bootcamp recently and hope to find a decent job in a high tech
  company.

  I like working with HTML,CSS,node.js and many more. If I was given an option
  to learn a computer programming language that would be definitely C language.
  I find it quite difficult to use for building loops. Other than programming, I
  love to workout. I go to gym almost 4 days a week and try to maintain a
  balance between my diet and workouts. And most importantly, I am a good cook
  as well. I love to make and eat indian food almost on all occasions.
